# SBIRTVR
A Soft Interaction Lab project, in collaboration with the Texas A&amp;M University Nursing program.
The Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) procedure is an approach to help patients that are struggling with substance abuse. This application lets students practice the SBIRT procedure on a virtual patient that is controlled by a professor via the desktop application. There is also a single-player version in which the virutal patient is controlled by an AI, developed by another student.
